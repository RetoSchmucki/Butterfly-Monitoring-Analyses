    "text": "Simulation\nTo demonstrate and rigorously demonstrate the method used to compute the Grassland Butterfly Indicator which involves calculating collated abundance indices from multiple sites and estimating the population trend from a set of indicator species, the best option is to use simulated datasets that provide realistic data with known parameters. The simulation approach allows us to assess the methods’ performance and enables us to control individual parameters and conduct rigorous sensitivity analysis. This method provides useful insight into the method and better assesses its power and limitations. To simulate butterfly count across sites and over multiple iterations, we will use the function developed by Collin Edwards and available in the R packages butterflyGamSims\nlibrary(data.table)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(butterflyGamSims)\nlibrary(rbms)\n\n Welcome to rbms, version 1.1.3 \n This package has been tested, but is still in active development and feedbacks are welcome\n https://github.com/RetoSchmucki/rbms/issues\nIn a first case, we will simulate counts for one site for one year, using a Gaussian curve to depict the adult butterflies’ seasonal phenology (activity curve).
