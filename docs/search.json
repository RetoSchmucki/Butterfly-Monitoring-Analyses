    "text": "Data Generation Processes\nTo develop robust monitoring methods and analyze the incoming data appropriately, it is important to understand the processes that generate the data and how the monitoring protocol affects the nature and structure of the data. For example, the life cycle of butterflies affects the number of adult individuals that can be observed in a given location at a given time. The seasonality of the emergence process creates a temporal pattern in the observed and recorded data that must be accounted for in the analysis. Systematic variation may also result from differences in sampling effort (e.g. the area sampled, the time spent recording or the experience of the recorders).\nUnderstanding the influence of both biological and sampling components on the data generation process is crucial for the design and development of methods that can filter out the component of interest while accounting for systematic structures in the data. This also helps in assessing whether the monitoring program accurately captures and reflects the population of interest or whether the sample is biased and unrepresentative. When designing a monitoring program, it is important to identify the population to be monitored and understand how the sampling protocol may affect the representativeness of the data and introduce potential bias.",

Data simulation involves generating random data sets based on defined rules and known parameters. This technique is useful not only to illustrate the outcome of ecological and sampling processes but also to test methods and improve our understanding of statistical models and their potential failures.\nWhen carefully designed, data simulation is a powerful tool for testing and validating methods and performing sensitivity analyses to assess their robustness to violations of underlying assumptions. Simulated data sets allow for exploring systematic patterns in the data and evaluating the behavior of models to identify their strengths and limitations.\nIn the following sections, we will use data simulations to illustrate and explore the different components of butterfly monitoring data generated under different scenarios. Through these simulations, we aim to 1) gain a deeper understanding of the data structure resulting from the ecological and sampling processes involved in butterfly monitoring schemes, 2) demonstrate and compare different modeling approaches and 3) understand the information that can be derived from these approaches.",

    "text": "Simulation Tool for Butterflies and Other Phenologies\nBecause butterflies’ life cycle is strongly structured in time, with species-specific phenologies, we must account for this ecological process when simulating individual counts recorded across an entire season. The temporal pattern in the number of adult butterflies (imago) is determined by their emergence rate, the timing of the emergence and the life span of the adult. These parameters will often result in the number of adult individuals increasing over a certain period, up to a peak after when their number starts to decline. If a species can produce more than one generation per season, the number will display additional waves of emergence, each with its respective start, peak and decline periods. For each generation, the hump-shaped temporal pattern in the number of adults can often be described by a function that has a mean (center), variance (width) and a certain level of skewness (asymmetry). When merged, the individual patterns can become hidden under the pattern resulting from the cumulative effect of partly overlapping generations.\nTo simulate butterfly count data with such phenological patterns, we will use the function timeseries_sim() from the R package butterflyGamSims developed by Collin Edwards (see Edwards et al. 2023). This package is freely available on GitHub and will allow us to generate realistic data sets under scenarios with various levels of complexity.\nWe illustrate how the timeseries_sim() function works with a simple case where we simulate butterfly counts for a univoltine species with a Gaussian pattern (i.e. one generation with Normal distribution), where the peak abundance is observed at day 175 with a standard deviation of 15 days.\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(13276)\n\nif(!require(\"butterflyGamSims\")) devtools::install_github(\"cbedwards/butterflyGamSims\")\n\nbtfl_data &lt;- timeseries_sim(nsims=1,\n               year = c(2023),\n               doy.samples = seq(from=1, to=365, by=1),\n               abund.type = \"exp\",\n               activity.type = \"gauss\",\n               sample.type = \"pois\",\n               sim.parms = list(growth.rate = 0,\n                                init.size = 500, \n                                act.mean = 175,\n                                act.sd = 15)\n               )\n\n\nThe object produced by the timeseries_sim() function contains 1) a data.frame NAME$timeseries with the time series and 2) a data.frame NAME$parms with the parameters used for the simulation. In the parameters, you will find the population growth rate (growth.rate), the initial population size (init. size) measure in number of individuals expected over the season, the peak of the activity curve (act.mean) measured in days and the width of the activity curve (act.sd) that is measured in standard deviation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that not all sampling parameters used for the simulation are included in the parms object; the activity.type (the distribution function used to define the activity curve), the sample.type (the sampling process used to sample random counts along the activity curve) and the abund.type (the type of the growth rate, deterministic or with a log-normal process error) are missing.",

In this first case, we will simulate a protocol with weekly visits and include some missing counts for weeks when the minimal monitoring conditions were not met or the observer was absent. For this, we will write some new R functions. The first function will define the start and end of the monitoring season and sample one monitoring day per week over the season. Then we will write functions to simulate a certain level of missing weekly visits within the season. The likelihood of missing weeks tends to be higher at the beginning and the end of the season and lower in the middle. Let’s start with the first function that defines the monitoring season and resamples one day of the simulated time series every week. We will name the function sim2bms() as it aligns the simulated time series to the protocol of a specific Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (BMS). The function needs the time series, and additional arguments to define the year that we want to extract yearKeep, if the time series must be resampled weekly weeklySample, which day should be used for the weekly resampling weekdayKeep (this can be a vector of days, e.g. c(2,3,4,5), or a specific day), and finally the monitoring season monitoringSeason which correspond to a vector of months, e.g c(4,5,6,7,8,9) represent a season starting in April and ending in September. Note that this function will also add some new variables such as the date, the ISO week number and the day of the week.\n\n\nCode\n# data: Time series resulting from the simulation generated for 365 days\n# weeklySample: TRUE or FALSE; should the daily count in the time series be resampled weekly?\n# weekdayKeep: vector of days c(1,2,..., 7) to be sampled from for the weekly count.

Because we sampled a count value for 365 days (day-of-year; doy), the counts are representative of the population of active adult butterflies as if the site was visited every. This implies that a proportion of butterflies are counted more than one day as their lifespan exceeds one day. On Pollard transect, this is how butterfly counts are likely to be counted and reported, but with a different frequency as visits are generally weekly, fortnightly, or even monthly. We can replicate this value by resampling the daily count weekly.\nFrom the weekly visits, counts outside of the monitoring period will not be informed, in many cases these are ‘zeros’ as we expect the monitoring season to align with butterflies’ activity. Some other weeks might be missing from the time series, potentially due to unsuitable weather conditions for monitoring or the recorder’s availability. We can inform and exclude the missing visits by resampling a subset of the weekly counts.\n\n\nCode\nmissing_prob &lt;- function(data, mu=NULL, alpha = 5, theta = 0.3){\n                              x_ &lt;- seq_len(nrow(data))\n                              mu_ &lt;- ifelse(is.null(mu), length(x_) / 2, mu)\n                              std_ &lt;- sqrt(mu_ / theta)\n                              y_ &lt;- abs((alpha * exp((-(x_ - mu_)^2) / std_^2)) - alpha) + alpha\n                              yn_ &lt;- y_ / (sum(y_))\n                        return(yn_)\n                  }\n\nsample_missing &lt;- function(data, propMissing = 0.25){\n            \n            missing.prob &lt;- data.table::data.table()\n            for(i in data[, unique(years)]){\n                  for(j in data[, unique(site_id)]){\n                  missing.prob &lt;- rbind(missing.prob, missing_prob(data[years == i & site_id == j, ]))\n                  }\n            }\n            \n            missing.week &lt;- data[sample(seq_len(.N), round(propMissing * .N), prob = unlist(missing.prob)), ]  \n      \n      return(missing.week)\n}\n\nbtfl_week_missing &lt;- sample_missing(data = btfl_week_smpl, propMissing = 0.25)\n\nbtfl_fig3 &lt;- ggplot() +\n                geom_point(data=btfl_week_smpl, aes(x=doy, y=count, colour = \"count\")) + \n                geom_point(data=btfl_week_missing, aes(x=doy, y=count, colour = \"missing\"), \n                            shape=4, size=2, stroke=2) + \n                geom_line(data = btfl_ts,\n                aes(x = doy, y = act, colour = \"activity\")) +\n                xlim(1,365) + ylim(0, max(btfl_ts$count, btfl_ts$act)) + \n                scale_colour_manual(\"\", \n                      breaks = c(\"count\", \"activity\", \"missing\"),\n                      values = c(cnt_col, flc_col, missing_col)) +\n                theme_light() + \n                theme(legend.position = \"inside\", legend.position.inside = c(0.9, 0.8)) +\n                labs(title = paste0(\"Simulated butterfly counts (\", y,\")\"),\n                     subtitle = \"- weekly visit (random resampled)\",\n                     x = \"Day of Year\",\n                     y = \"Count\")\nbtfl_fig3",

The NM variable is scaled to an Area Under the Curve (AUC) that sum to 1. To compare the flight curve derived from the GAM with the activity curve used for the simulation, we must rescale them to the same AUC, in other words, we must rescale the activity curve to have an AUC of 1 or rescale the NM to the population size used for the simulation. Here we will rescale the NM to match the simulation population size, this will allow us to display the curves and the counts on the same plot with the correct scale.\n\n\nCode\npheno &lt;- ts_flight_curve$pheno\n\nbtfl_fig4 &lt;- ggplot() +\n                geom_point(data=ts_season_count[ANCHOR == 0 & !is.na(COUNT), ], aes(x=DAY_SINCE, y=COUNT, colour = \"count\")) +\n                geom_point(data=btfl_week_missing, aes(x=doy, y=count, colour = \"missing\"), \n                            shape=4, size=2, stroke=2) + \n                geom_line(data = btfl_ts, aes(x = doy, y = act, colour = \"activity\")) +\n                geom_line(data = pheno,\n                    aes(x = trimDAYNO, y = btfl_ts[,unique(abund.true)]*NM, colour = \"GAM_fit\")) +\n                xlim(1,365) + ylim(0, max(btfl_ts$act, \n                                          pheno$NM*btfl_ts[,unique(abund.true)], \n                                          btfl_week_missing$count, \n                                          ts_season_count[!is.na(COUNT), COUNT] )) + \n                scale_colour_manual(\"\", \n                      breaks = c(\"count\", \"activity\", \"missing\", \"GAM_fit\"),\n                      values = c(cnt_col, flc_col, missing_col, GAM_col)) +\n                theme_light() + \n                theme(legend.position = \"inside\", legend.position.inside = c(0.9, 0.8)) +\n                labs(title = paste0(\"Simulated butterfly counts (\", y,\")\"),\n                     subtitle = \"- Fitting GAM model with rbms\",\n                     x = \"Day of Year\",\n                     y = \"Count\")\nbtfl_fig4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo compare the fitted curve with the activity curve, we should use a standard AUC of 1 to enable a fair comparison between models fitted to different population sizes.

    "text": "Multisite and trends\nHere we will simulate butterfly count data for multiple sites (100), for a univoltine species that has a simple Gaussian flight curve (peak at day 175), where each population has an initial number of 500 individuals (total number of observations accumulated over the season) and a mean population growth rate of 20% over 10 years (2010 to 2020). We introduce some variation (standard deviation of 0.02) in the growth rate observed across the 100 sites.\nFor this simulation, we will use the timeseries_sim() function from the butterflyGamSims package and the sim2bms() function written above to reformat the simulated data into a format that can be used in the rbms package.\nCode\nset.seed(13276)\n\nif(!require(\"butterflyGamSims\")) devtools::install_github(\"cbedwards/butterflyGamSims\")\n\ntrend_sim &lt;- data.table()\n\nfor(i in 1:100){\n\n      btfl_data &lt;- timeseries_sim(nsims=1,\n                  year = c(2010:2020),\n                  doy.samples = seq(from=1, to=365, by=1),\n                  abund.type = \"exp\",\n                  activity.type = \"gauss\",\n                  sample.type = \"pois\",\n                  sim.parms = list(growth.rate = rnorm(1, mean = 0.2, sd=0.02),\n                                    init.size = 500, \n                                    act.mean = 175,\n                                    act.sd = 15)\n                  )\n\n      trend_sim &lt;- rbind(trend_sim, \n                        sim2bms(data = btfl_data$timeseries, \n                              weeklySample = TRUE,\n                              weekdayKeep = c(2:5),\n                              monitoringSeason = c(4:9))[,\n                              growth.rate := btfl_data$parms$growth.rate][,\n                              site_id := paste0(\"site_id\", i)])\n\n}\nknitr::kable(head(trend_sim))\nCode\n## plot and add lm\n\ntrend_sim[, y_count := sum(count), by = .(site_id, years)]\nplot(unique(trend_sim[, .(years, log(y_count))]), pch = 19, col = \"darkcyan\", \n      ylab = \"Butterfly abundance (log)\", xlab = \"Year\")\n\nfor(i in 1:100){\n    abline(lm(log(y_count) ~ years, data = trend_sim[site_id == paste0(\"site_id\", i), .(years, y_count)]),  \n            col = 'orange')\n}\nThe overall trend can be calculated by fitting a Generalized Linear Model (GLM), with a Poisson error distribution on the simulated dataset.
